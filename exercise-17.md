This exercise's task is: The majority of countries around the globe use the Gregorian calendar. However, there are other systems to measure and organise time. Below you will find three news articles from countries that have not adopted the Gregorian calendar.

Your task is to find out when the articles were published, according to the Gregorian calendar.

Analysis/ thought process- 
I started with the second article for some reason. I copy and pasted words from the article and inserted them into google translate, it said 2072 Magh 17. After another google search I find this is from the nepali calender, from there I just searched up a nepali calender- gregorian converter, we have the second articles date now of January 31, 2016. 
I now clicked on the first link, I copy and pasted the words under the picture into google translate. "The 14th Tokyo Marathon ended minutes ago, with Ethiopian athlete Berhanu Legesse finishing the race in first place." We now know from the translation and the picture this was at the Tokyo maraathon in 2020, and it just ended. Now after searching the date of the Tokyo marathon, we know this article was written March 1, 2020.
After several attempts, the link for the third article in exercise 17 that Sofia Santos provided isn't functioning for me. I copy and pasted the link title and found the article that way. I copy and pasted sections from the article and found a persion date 2̱ esfand 1̱4̱0̱1̱ 1̱5̱:1̱7̱. I then converted it to gregorian calendar which is February 21, 2023.
