Exercise Overview – A video of an earthquake from a security camera. There is no information provided besides the video. The mission objective is to answer these two questions.

What was the magnitude of the earthquake?

What are the coordinates of where the camera was likely to be in order to record this video.

Analysis – To begin the exercise, I took note of the date in the corner of the recording footage, 9/24/16, so now I know when it happened. I go to Google and search the date for earthquakes that day. Multiple results come up for that date, Romania/Fiji/Philippines, so now I will deepen my search. In the recording, besides the date, the time is listed 02:18.
This updated search information leads to multiple websites describing an earthquake that happened in Romania on 9/24/16 at 2h 11min and was described to be felt in regions of Ukraine as well. I am now confident this is the event that took place in the video. I go to multiple websites that confirm the same information. A Romania Insider news article states Romania’s National Institute for Earth Physics (INFP) initially reported 5.7, but adjusted to 5.3, so that is going to be the answer to our first question, 5.3.

Now to answer the second question. In the right-hand corner of the video, the words “Terminal 3” are listed, so I am going to research and see if this could give any insight into the location of this recording. I didn't have any luck finding anything with just the words Terminal 3 Nereju, Romania. I am now going to take a screenshot of the video and reverse image search it to see if I can find any clues. Reverse image search didn't produce any immediate information either.

I was out of obvious ideas at this point, so I had to start critically thinking. I knew if the epicenter of the earthquake was in Nereju, Vrancea, and the timestamp of the recording was 7 minutes later than when the earthquake hit, that the city in the footage would have to have been pretty far away. I thought that Bucharest could be an option, but Google Earth and building searches provided no evidence of that.

I then returned to reverse image search again and clicked on some of the foreign-language links and translated the title of a post that said “earthquake in Chisinau” that had an image of the same location in the video I'm looking for. I had also seen a video earlier titled “earthquake in Moldova,” but I just noted it because I had determined the earthquake happened in Romania and my search was inside Romania at first, but now I returned to it after eliminating all cities close to the epicenter.

As soon as I got over Chisinau in Google Earth, I'm using the big white building in the video as the main landmark I've been looking for. I go to an area of the city I think matches the video the best by guessing and went to Street View. I find the landmark building I'm looking for. After lining it up with the video, I have answered the second question of the exercise. The video was most likely taken from the V Continental Business Center.

Coordinates – 47.017760, 28.852530 using Google Earth's coordinates of the right-hand side of the building.

Answers –
Magnitude of earthquake – 5.3 magnitude
Most likely coordinates – 47.017760N, 28.852530E

Tools used – Google Earth, ImgOps reverse image search, Google.
