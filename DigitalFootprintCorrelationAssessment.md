       Assessment Judgement 

Correlation of coverage on AI evolution across media outlets frames AI as 
a high-impact and potentially disruptive technology. The differing emphasis of
outlets was economic risk, societal risk, and concerns about regulatory 
influence. This suggests narrative alignment driven by shared concerns rather 
than coordinated messaging.

  Confidence Statement

Confidence Level: Moderate
Rationale: Limited dataset and timeframe, but framing is consistent across 
media outlets and formats.
