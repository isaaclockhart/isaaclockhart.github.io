Exercise description- This exercise involves a screenshot of a declassified CIA document. It is a caption report of an undisclosed photo taken by an agent, in the text it mentions a telescope being assembled at a factory. 

My task in this exercise is to answer these two questions: 
a) A photo that matches the description on the caption report.
b) The exact location of where the telescope was placed once completed.

Analysis/ thought process- My initial thought process to begin this exercise after reading the caption report is to come up with my initial research material. From the report I know this was Jan 18 Berlin, Germany 1953 and the telescope is being assembled at the Askania factory for the University of Bonn. I know some details about the telescope for later in my search as well. I first begin by searching up "Askania factory telescope 1953" and the firs result is a website and picture with the exact wording as the report. The next website is of a newspaper article of a giant camera being built in berlin at the Askania facotry weighing 3 tons, over 18 feet tall, and same describing qualities as the caption report lists. I now have a photo that matches the description. I now need to find out where it went. In a UNESCO website article I have found a photo and description 34/50-cm-Schmidt Telescope, Askania of Berlin (1954), (Hoher List, Tower 1, 1953/54). Now I have to find out the coordinates to Tower 1, the website shows a picture of tower 1, so I can use that to determine which tower is tower 1 on a overhead view. I now will use Google Earth to find the coordinates.
