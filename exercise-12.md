# OSINT Exercise #12: Task Briefing

## Purpose / Question
The goal of this exercise is to analyze a satellite image of a coastline with thermal anomalies and figure out where it came from, which country is shown, and when the image was taken. The exercise is meant to practice basic OSINT observation and geospatial reasoning using publicly available data.

## Scope & Limitations
This exercise only uses publicly available satellite imagery and open-source data. Analysis is based on what can be observed in the image and supporting references. 

## Sources & Collection Method
 Key sources included NASA FIRMS for thermal anomaly data to match thermal anomolies with the task photo. Visual inspection of coastline layout and comparison with reference maps helped identify the country and date.

## Analysis
The satellite image was examined to identify patterns of thermal anomalies and coastal features. Observations were cross-checked with open-source geospatial references to determine the country and confirm the date. The source of the imagery was inferred from platform-specific markers and search engine research. Uncertainties were noted throughout the process.

## Assessment & Confidence
- **Imagery Source:** NASA FIRMS — High confidence  
- **Country Identified:** Chile — High confidence  
- **Date of Imagery:** January 26, 2017 — High confidence  

These conclusions are based on careful analysis. Confidence levels reflect the certainty of the assessment given the quality of the imagery, website feature comparison and high probability of match with thermal anomaly data on NASA FIRM on jan 26,2017 with task photo.

## Notes / Lessons Learned
This exercise reinforced the importance of careful observation and cross-checking multiple open-source references as well as documenting methodology. Overall, it was a useful exercise in geospatial reasoning and analytic tradecraft.
