Exercise task-
In May 2023, the world witnessed the coronation of King Charles III at Westminster Abbey in London. Following the ceremony, and similarly to the previous regent, the monarch travelled through the city in a lavish carriage. The route of the 2023 royal procession differed from that of 1953.

Your task is to:
a) Identify from which exact door Queen Elizabeth II left Westminster Abbey after her coronation.
b) Measure the distance travelled by the Queen’s carriage, following the 1953 coronation.
c) Estimate the average speed at which the Queen’s carriage travelled.

Analysis/ thought process-
For this exercise I first need to start by researching Queen Elizabeth II exiting Westminster Abbey after the coronation. After some research, I find an article stating the queen exited the abbey throught the west door. Now to find the distance traveled. I found an article stating it was 7.2km,but measuring it says 8.2km. It's stated the coronation took about 100 minutes, if you do the math, that comes out about 3mph.

a. West door
b. 7.2km
c. 3mph
